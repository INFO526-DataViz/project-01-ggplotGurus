**Question 1:** How does the error in temperature prediction vary across the United States? And can we identify clusters of cities with similar error patterns?

**Introduction:**

Weather Forecast Accuracy is a significant domain of study, given the dependency of various industries, transportation, and even day-to-day activities on weather predictions. Precise forecasting can significantly impact logistics, energy sector decisions, agriculture, and more. This project's objective is to understand the accuracy of temperature forecasting across the U.S., examining which areas face challenges in weather prediction and delving into potential reasons for discrepancies. The data comprises 16 months of forecasts and observations from 167 cities, which serves as the foundation for this study.

**Approach:**

To assess the error in temperature prediction across the U.S. and identify clusters of cities with similar error patterns, we will utilize advanced geospatial data visualization techniques. Our methodology will involve the creation of a choropleth map of the United States, presenting a clear visual representation of temperature forecasting errors for cities.

1. **Choropleth Map:** This map will be generated using the following variables:
    - Latitude
    - Longitude
    - Cities
    - Temperature forecasting errors

2. **Temperature Forecasting Errors Calculation:** The errors will be determined using:
    - Observed Temperature (Degrees Fahrenheit)
    - Forecasted Temperature (Degrees Fahrenheit)

3. **Clustering Cities Based on Regional Error Patterns:** To further dissect the data:
    - Cities will be categorized by state.
    - Regional averages of errors will be computed to identify patterns.

Incorporating a dark mode design will provide a modern, visually appealing look to our visualizations.

**Discussion:**

Upon examination of the provided plots:

1. **Mean Temperature Prediction Error by State:** 
   - Certain states display a higher mean error in temperature prediction compared to others. For instance, AK (Alaska) has the highest error, followed by states like OR (Oregon), HI (Hawaii), and NV (Nevada). On the other end, states like SC (South Carolina) exhibit the least prediction error.
   - This variation might be due to the geographical intricacies and climatic conditions of certain states, making them more challenging to predict.

2. **Mean Temperature Prediction Error Across US Cities:** 
   - The scatter plot exhibits clusters of cities with similar temperature prediction errors based on their latitudinal and longitudinal positions.
   - We notice cities in the northwest (higher latitudes and lower longitudes) tend to have higher errors. In contrast, cities in the southeast exhibit fewer errors.
   - This clustering indicates potential regional factors influencing the accuracy of predictions. Regions with more volatile weather patterns or fewer weather observation resources might account for higher discrepancies.

In summary, while the U.S. National Weather Service provides extensive forecasting, certain regions and cities experience more significant temperature prediction errors than others. Understanding these discrepancies and their underlying causes can pave the way for improvements in forecasting models, ensuring more accurate and reliable predictions in the future.
