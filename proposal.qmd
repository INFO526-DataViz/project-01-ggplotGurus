## Dataset

This dataset represents to Weather Forecast Accuracy and is sourced from the USA National Weather Service. It encompasses 16 months of weather forecasts and subsequent observations for 167 cities across the United States. Weather_forecast Accuracy is divided into three dimensions, `weather_forecasts`, `cities`, and `outlook_meanings`.

The first dataset we'll look at is `weather_forecasts`, which contains 651,968 observations of 10 variables. Specifically, this includes forecasted and observed temperatures, time differences between observations and forecasts, precipitation, forecast outlook and the presence of potential error. The second dataset we'll look at is `cities`, which contains 236 observations of 11 variables with geographic information such as latitude, longitude, and climate for 236 cities, including the 167 cities we'll be looking at. The last dataset, `outlook_meanings`, contains 23 observations of 2 variables and is the one that describes the aforementioned variable, `forecast_outlook`.

## Why do we chose this dataset.

```         
Our Data Visualization class project requires us to work collaboratively on a dataset of our choice to create meaningful visualizations. 
After careful consideration, we have chosen to work with a weather forecast dataset, for several compelling reasons:

1.  Richness and Depth: The dataset holds an extensive range of information, covering 16 months of forecasts and observations from 167 cities. With variables including temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed, among others, this dataset offers an opportunity to visualize and analyze diverse aspects of weather patterns, enabling a comprehensive understanding of meteorological trends.
2.  Learning Opportunities: Working with weather forecast data challenges us to apply the data visualization skills we acquired in class to a complex and dynamic dataset. This hands-on experience will undoubtedly enhance our proficiency in data analysis and visualization.
3.  Historical connections:Weather has been one of the earliest uses of data visualization techniques. Early as 1875 Sir Francis Galton created the daily weather chart that was published in The Times newspaper. We aim to continue this legacy by being part of the innovation, in data visualization. Through this project we strive to push the boundaries of creating weather related data in todays era
4.  Weather Intelligence Industry: Finally, our choice was motivated by the currently thriving weather intelligence industry. In today's data-driven world, companies like Tomorrow.io and EarthNetworks.comhave created a demand for precise and clear weather data and insights. This not only aligns with industry needs, but also provides us with a chance to enhance our data analysis and visualization skills in a highly relevant context.
In summary, we are excited about the potential of our weather forecast data project and are committed to producing exceptional visualizations. We look forward to using this dataset to create informative and engaging visualizations that showcase our skills and contribute meaningfully to the field of data visualization.
